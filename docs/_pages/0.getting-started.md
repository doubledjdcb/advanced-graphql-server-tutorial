# Getting Started

In this tutorial, you will learn how to connect your GraphQL server to multiple backend data sources and optimize the server for efficiency. The exercises in
this project will require data to be available from multiple sources. These data sources are made available via Docker containers and are available in the
[https://github.com/hydrateio/advanced-graphql-server-tutorial](https://github.com/hydrateio/advanced-graphql-server-tutorial) repository.

This tutorial will not cover unit or integration testing for the GraphQL server. There are many great tutorials about unit and integration testing of Node.js
applications and you are strongly encouraged to go through those tutorials and add testing to any project you create.

## Sample Code and Data

Before we begin, you will want to clone this repository locally, checkout the “step-0-setup-base-project” branch and follow the instructions in the
Prerequisites section of the README to install Node.js and Docker.

Once you have installed all prerequisites, you can start the databases and populate initial data by running <code class="language-shell">npm run
data-start</code> from the root of the project directory.

The code repository is set up with multiple branches that correspond to the individual sections of this tutorial. When switching between branches, you will want
to re-run <code class="language-shell">npm ci</code> to install any dependencies that were added for that step and then restart the server with <code
class="language-shell">npm run debug</code>.

## Starting Point

The initial GraphQL server in the “step-0-setup-base-project” branch picks up where most GraphQL tutorials leave off in that you have some hard coded data and a
few basic types and queries. In the coming steps, we will replace these basic items with more advanced functionality.

For now, we’ll start our GraphQL server and run some test queries on this static data source.

In your command prompt run <code class="language-shell">npm ci</code> from the root of the project to install all dependencies based on the package-lock.json
file.

## Verify Server State

Once all dependencies are installed, run the dev server with <code class="language-shell">npm run debug</code> to start the GraphQL server. The server is based
on apollo-server-express which adds a graphql route to the running server when running in non-production mode.  After starting the server, open
[http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql](http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql) in your browser window to view the graphql playground.

We can verify the server is running correctly by sending the following query

<pre><code class="language-graphql">{
  checkouts {
    userEmail
    assetUpc
    checkoutDate
    checkinDate
  }
}</code></pre>

You should now see a list of results as shown below.

Our basic server setup also allows for query parameters for the checkouts resource. Let's verify this is working by sending an updated query.

<pre><code class="language-graphql">{
  checkouts (userEmail: "dbernath27@jalbum.net") {
    userEmail
    assetUpc
    checkoutDate
    checkinDate
  }
}</code></pre>

You should now see an updated list of results as shown below.

Now that we have our basic project set up, we can move onto Step 1 where we will learn how to replace the statically defined data with a call to a MySQL
database.
