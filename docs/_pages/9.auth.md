# Authentication & Authorization

In this tutorial we will be adding both authentication and authorization to our GraphQL Server. Authentication involves properly validating that a user is who
they claim to be and then storing information about that user for later use in authorization methods. Authorization is when we take that validated information
about a user and make decisions based on that information on whether or not the user has access to particular information or to perform a particular task.

In today's world of web development, the number of options available for authentication methods are extensive. From basic authentication against a locally
managed user database to OAuth services provided by so many social media platforms with each having their own pros and cons. This tutorial cannot cover them
all, however the steps that we will go through can easily be applied to multiple authentication methods.

When implementing the authentication method in this tutorial, we are going to rely on Express middleware to make the steps as transferrable as possible to any
other express middleware. The Express.js ecosystem has a great many authentication middleware projects which should make the following steps interchangeable
with whichever method you choose.

As a general overview, authentication in our GraphQL server involves validating the credentials a user sends to the server, retrieving information about that
validated user and attaching that information to the GraphQL request context so that we can later use the user information to determine authorization to data
and tasks.

## Authentication a User

### A note on sessions

One of the goals that we want to accomplish with our GraphQL server is to make it as stateless as possible. Some authentication middleware allow for the
persistence of session information so that subsequent requests to the server do not require the user to send credentials each time but rather session
information. If you choose to implement authentication middleware with sessions, be certain to abstract your session management into a central session service
so that it is not coupled to an individual instance of a GraphQL server.

### JWTs

Another popular authentication implementation that many organizations use to solve the stateless session problem is to use [JSON Web
Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token). We'll be using JWTs in this tutorial to minimize the code required to set up authentication in order to
show concepts over implementation detail. As Sven Slootweg describes in his [blog post on
JWTs](http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/06/13/stop-using-jwt-for-sessions/) there are some concepts to consider before deciding on using them in your
environment.

### Demo support

This tutorial is going to assume that our GraphQL server is just one service in a larger organization and that in our organization we have some sort of central
authentication mechanism. In the data-sources directory of our project, a new JWT Service has been added to fulfill this assumption. Before continuing, you will
want to either checkout the [Auth](https://github.com/hydrateio/advanced-graphql-server-tutorial/tree/step-9-auth) branch or verify you have added the [JWT
Service to the docker compose file](https://github.com/hydrateio/advanced-graphql-server-tutorial/blob/step-9-auth/data-sources/docker-compose.yml#L55) and
added the [JWT Service directory](https://github.com/hydrateio/advanced-graphql-server-tutorial/tree/step-9-auth/data-sources/JWTService) and then run <code
class="language-shell">npm run data-stop</code> and <code class="language-shell">npm run data-start</code>.

Four different users have been created with different roles.

| username | password | roles |
|----------|----------|-------|
| user1 | password1 | admin, librarian, user |
| user2 | password2 | librarian, user |
| user3 | password3 | user |
| apickerin0@51.la | password | user |

You can then use <code class="language-shell">curl</code> to obtain a JWT for each user for testing. The following code will get a JWT for user1.

<pre><code class="language-shell">
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:4080/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'username=user1&password=password1'
</code></pre>
<br />

### Validate the user

When making an authenticated request to our GraphQL server, the user must send some sort of credential to the server. In the case of a JWT, we will be using the
"Authentication" header and sending a "Bearer" token that contains the JWT we retrieved via curl. We can do this in our GraphQL Playground by adding the
Authorization header in the "HTTP HEADERS" section below the query pane.

![playground-headers]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screenshots/auth/graphql-playground-headers.png)

Now that we are sending that token to the server, we'll need to write some middleware to verify the token and handle errors. The first middleware that we'll
write is the token validation middleware.

Our organization uses asynchronous key pairs to sign and validate JWTs so that a single secret does not need to be shared throughout the organization. The first
helper function that we will write is an asynchronous method to retrieve the public key provided by our JWT service. We'll write a <code
class="language-javascript">getSecret()</code> function and use <code class="language-javascript">fetch</code> to download our public key from the JWT service
at the url specified in our environment variables. We'll keep it in a small cache and only re-retrieve it every hour.

We'll also add a small <code class="language-javascript">getTokenFromHttpRequest()</code> helper function that we can use to retrieve the token from the request
headers and create an error if a user is attempting to use a different authentication method.

The last helper we'll write is a <code class="language-javascript">getUserFromToken()</code> function that takes our token and verifies its validity. When doing
this, we'll want to make certain that we've specified the "RS256" algorithm that we're using to address certain
[vulnerabilities](https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/). Since we're going to want to have a mix of authenticated and
unauthenticated queries we'll simply call the <code class="language-javascript">next()</code> callback in our authMiddleware if no authentication header was
sent.

Our <code class="language-javascript">authMiddleware()</code> will pass the request information to our helpers and if there are no errors will attach a
"currentUser" object to the HTTP request before calling <code class="language-javascript">next()</code> to proceed with the middleware chain.  If there are
errors, we'll create a <code class="language-javascript">authErrorHandler()</code> middleware to pass those errors to and form a GraphQL compliant response.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: src/middleware/jwt.js
import jwt, { JsonWebTokenError } from 'jsonwebtoken';
import * as fetch from 'node-fetch';
import env from '../env';

const pubKeyCache = {
  key: null,
  expires: 0,
};

const getSecret = async () => {
  if (!pubKeyCache.key || pubKeyCache.expires < Date.now()) {
    const key = await fetch(env.PUBLIC_JWT_KEY_URL).then(res => res.text());
    const expires = Date.now() + (60 * 60 * 1000); // 60 minutes
    pubKeyCache.key = key;
    pubKeyCache.expires = expires;
  }
  return pubKeyCache.key;
};

const getTokenFromHttpRequest = (req) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
  if (!authHeader) {
    return null;
  }
  const [type, credentials] = authHeader.split(' ');
  if (type !== 'Bearer') {
    throw new JsonWebTokenError('INVALID_TOKEN', { message: 'Unsupported Authentication Type' });
  }
  return credentials;
};

export const getUserFromToken = async (token) => {
  const secret = await getSecret();
  const user = jwt.verify(token, secret, {
    algorithm: 'RS256', // Very important when using key pairs!
  });
  return user;
};

export const authMiddleware = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const token = getTokenFromHttpRequest(req);
    if (!token) {
      next();
      return;
    }
    const user = await getUserFromToken(token);
    if (user) {
      req.currentUser = user;
    }
    next();
    return;
  } catch (e) {
    next(e);
  }
};

export const authErrorHandler = (err, req, res, next) => {
  if (err instanceof JsonWebTokenError) {
    res.status(401);
    res.json({
      errors: [{
        message: err.message,
        extensions: {
          code: 'AUTH_TOKEN_ERROR',
        },
      }],
    });
  } else {
    next(err);
  }
};
</code></pre>
<br />

While the above code is specific to JSON Web Tokens, the concepts that can be applied to any other authentication method are as follows:

- User will pass credentials to the GraphQL Server
  - This could be a username/password combination, Authorization header or session information in a cookie
- Express Middleware can be used to handle validating the credentials passed to the server and append a "currentUser" object to the HTTP Request if valid
  - In our example, the authMiddleware handles this functionality
- If there is an error in user authentication, the error is handled and a GraphQL error response is sent
  - In our example, the authErrorHandler middleware handles this functionality
  - GraphQL response structure is defined in [section 7.1 of the spec](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/June2018/#sec-Response)
- Middleware is configured to not error when no authentication credentials are sent
  - This is true if we want to handle both authenticated and unauthenticated queries
  - If all requests should be authenticated, we can adjust the logic in our authMiddleware to pass an error to the <code
    class="language-javascript">next()</code> callback if no credentials are sent

Now in our express server setup, we'll apply our middleware

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: src/index.js
...
<mark>import { authErrorHandler, authMiddleware } from './middleware';</mark>

const app = express();
<mark>app.use(authMiddleware, authErrorHandler);</mark>
const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
  context,
});
...
</code></pre>
<br />

### Attach the User to the GraphQL Context

Now that whichever authentication middleware we've chosen has attached a "currentUser" to our HTTP Request we can take that user object and attach it to our
GraphQL context for our queries and mutations.  In our context setup, we simply need to retrieve the currentUser from the req object and attach it to the
context.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: src/context/index.js
import getDataLoaders from './data-loaders';
import { KafkaPubSub } from '../data-connectors/kafka';

export default async ({ connection, req }) => {
  const kafka = new KafkaPubSub();

  if (connection) {
    return {
      ...connection.context,
      loaders: getDataLoaders(),
      pubsub: { kafka },
    };
  }

  if (req.errors) {
    throw req.errors;
  }
  return {
    loaders: getDataLoaders(),
    pubsub: { kafka },
    <mark>currentUser: req.currentUser,</mark>
  };
};
</code></pre>
<br />

For our subscriptions, the currentUser object will need to be attached earlier in the connection process. Apollo Server config takes a <code
class="language-javascript">subscriptions</code> object where we'll be attaching our user object. This config object takes an <code
class="language-javascript">onConnect()</code> callback which merges the returned object with the GraphQL context. When creating a web socket connection in the
client, the client will need to provide the JWT when using tokens as the value of the <code class="language-javascript">authToken</code> connection param. This
onConnect callback function will look for that param and use the same methods as our middleware to validate the token and add the "currentUser" to the context.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
File: src/index.js
...
import { authErrorHandler, authMiddleware, <mark>getUserFromToken</mark> } from './middleware';

const app = express();
app.use(authMiddleware, authErrorHandler);

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
  context,
  <mark>subscriptions: {
    onConnect: async (connectionParams) => {
      if (connectionParams.authToken) {
        const currentUser = await getUserFromToken(connectionParams.authToken);
        return { currentUser };
      }
      return {};
    },
  },</mark>
});
...
</code></pre>
<br />

## Authorizing the User

Now that we have validated information about the user currently accessing our API, we can start to make decisions on what this user is authorized to do in our
system. These decisions can be placed in many different locations in your code. Your decisions will depend on your user base and the information in your system.

One general guideline that I can suggest is to keep decisions about who can access what data as close to the data as possible. Here are some scenarios to
describe that guideline:

- Anyone who can log into the application has full access to the application capabilities (schema authorization)
  - This scenario is common with non-confidential information, such as a historical records query API where a subscriber can access all records
  - The database will be set up with a single user for the application
  - A list of authorized users will be maintained
  - During the connection process, a user must both authenticate and be included in the authorized users list
- Different users have varying access to read/write/update data which may include partial rows from a database table (external authorization)
  - This scenario is common in organizational financial applications where finances for multiple parts of an organization are housed in a single place
    - A CFO may have access to all records in the database while a accounts manager may only have access to the database rows involving their division
  - Ideally, the database will be set up with multiple users and access to information will be handled at the database level
  - The GraphQL server will proxy user credentials to the database server and create a new database connection with each request
  - The connection to the database will be attached to and referenced from the GraphQL request context
  - During the connection process, a user must both authenticate and be included in the authorized users list
  - No additional access logic will need to be added to the GraphQL resolvers
- Different users have varying access to read/write/update data which may include partial rows from a database table (resolver/directives authorization)
  - This scenario is common in large scale applications that pull from multiple (sometimes legacy) data sources which makes user management at the database
    level impractical
  - Business logic must be added to the individual query, mutation and subscription calls to restrict access

In this tutorial, we will be focusing on the 3rd scenario and go over techniques to add granular authorization to our GraphQL server.

### Authorization via resolvers

One of the functions currently in our library server is the ability to check an asset back into the library. It makes sense for use to restrict this
functionality only to the librarian staff. The easiest way to accomplish this is to modify our <code class="language-javascript">checkinAsset()</code> mutation
resolver to check the context for a currently logged in user and verify that they have the role of "librarian".

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: src/schema/checkout/checkout.model.js
checkinAsset: async (root, args, context) => {
  if (!context.currentUser || !context.currentUser.roles.includes('librarian')) {
    throw new ApolloError('not authorized', 'NOT_AUTHORIZED');
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<br />

In our schema definition we'll also want to add a description to this mutation that describes the authorization level needed to perform the operation.

<pre><code class="language-graphql">
// File: src/schema/checkout/checkout.typeDef.js
  extend type Mutation {
    checkoutAsset(assetUpc: String!, userEmail: String! @email): CheckOut!

    "User must have a role of librarian to complete this task."
    checkinAsset(assetUpc: String!): CheckOut!
    
    changeSomething: String!
  }
</code></pre>
<br />

If we now attempt to check an asset back into the library without sending an authorization header along with our request or if the user associated with the
token in the authorization header is not a librarian, our GraphQL server will respond with an error stating the user is not authorized to perform this action.

For scenarios where we want to restrict access to rows of data in a table, we may pass the context from our resolver down to the methods created to interact
with our database and construct our queries. We would then pass arguments via a filter (an SQL <code class="language-sql">WHERE</code> clause for example) that
would restrict results from our database to only the information the user is authorized to view.

In our library api we will want to allow users to look up their own checkout history without having access to other users. Let's update our method that fetches
the list of checkouts from our database to add an additional filter to the query if the user does not have the role of admin or librarian. With this new filter,
only rows associated with the currently logged in user will be returned from the database.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: src/schema/checkout.checkout.model.js
  getCheckouts: async (root, args, context) => {
  <mark>const queryArgs = { ...args };
  const { currentUser } = context;
  if (!currentUser.roles.includes('librarian') || !currentUser.roles.includes('admin')) {
    queryArgs.userEmail = currentUser.name;
  }
  const query = getQueryStr(queryArgs);</mark>
  const queryResults = await mysqlDataConnector.pool.query(query);
  return queryResults;
}
</code></pre>
<br />

Putting authorization logic in our resolvers allows us to granularly allow for access to entire data objects or specific attributes on those objects, however
the business logic can end up being spread throughout our code which may make sustaining that logic more difficult. Abstracting the actual authorization
business logic out of the resolvers into authorization utility methods is a good way to prevent this from happening.

### Authorization with Custom Directives

Custom directives allow us to abstract certain authorization business logic into central and easy to manage methods. They work great when the access control
needed on your application applies to operations, entire objects or specific fields.

Let's add a new directive for authorizing based on roles and call that directive 'auth'.

Just like our date formatting directive we'll need to define the type def for our directive. We'll also define an enum that states the acceptable values for our
roles.

<pre><code class="language-graphql">
# File: src/schema/directives/auth.js
export const typeDef = /* GraphQL */`
  directive @auth(
    requires: UserRole = ADMIN
    allowSelf: Boolean = false
  ) on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION | MUTATION | QUERY | SUBSCRIPTION

  enum UserRole {
    ADMIN
    LIBRARIAN
    USER
  }
`;
</code></pre>
<br />

Next we'll define our AuthDirective. Our directive is going to take two arguments. The first argument will be the role the current user is required to have. the
second argument is going to be a boolean that states whether the role can be overridden if the current user is querying information about themselves. This
second argument will be useful when resolving patron information. Since we're going to want to apply our directive to both field definitions & types as well as
queries & mutations, we'll need to define both <code class="language-javascript">visitFieldDefinition()</code> and <code
class="language-javascript">visitObject()</code> methods. Since much of the logic will be reused, an abstracted <code
class="language-javascript">ensureFieldsWrapped()</code> method can be created and used when visiting both locations and eliminate double wrapping.  Our JWT has
been set up so that the <code class="language-javascript">sub</code> field matches the patron ID so we can use that to check if the object correlates to the
parent's id if the parent type is a Patron or the root id when reconciling fields when the return type is Patron. Unlike our date formatting directive, we don't
want to publish the arguments to our schema since it doesn't make sense for the client to restrict access to data so we will purposefully avoid pushing argument
definitions onto the fields.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: src/schema/directives/auth.js

// Based on https://blog.apollographql.com/reusable-graphql-schema-directives-131fb3a177d1
class AuthDirective extends SchemaDirectiveVisitor {
  visitObject(type) {
    this.ensureFieldsWrapped(type);
    type._requiredAuthRole = this.args.requires;
    type._allowSelf = this.args.allowSelf;
  }

  visitFieldDefinition(field, details) {
    this.ensureFieldsWrapped(details.objectType);
    field._requiredAuthRole = this.args.requires;
    field._allowSelf = this.args.allowSelf;
  }

  ensureFieldsWrapped(objectType) {
    // Mark the GraphQLObjectType object to avoid re-wrapping:
    if (objectType._authFieldsWrapped) return;
    objectType._authFieldsWrapped = true;

    const fields = objectType.getFields();

    Object.keys(fields).forEach((fieldName) => {
      const field = fields[fieldName];
      const { resolve = defaultFieldResolver } = field;

      field.resolve = async (root, args, context, info) => {
        const requiredRole = field._requiredAuthRole || objectType._requiredAuthRole;
        const allowSelf = field._allowSelf || objectType._allowSelf;

        const authError = new ApolloError('not authorized', 'NOT_AUTHORIZED');
        if (!requiredRole) {
          return resolve.apply(this, [root, args, context, info]);
        }

        const { currentUser } = context;
        if (!currentUser) {
          throw authError;
        }

        const userRoles = currentUser.roles.map(r => r.toUpperCase()) || [];
        const hasRole = userRoles.includes(requiredRole);

        if (!hasRole && !allowSelf) {
          throw authError;
        }

        const value = await resolve.apply(this, [root, args, context, info]);
        let isSelf = false;
        if (info.returnType.name === 'Patron' && value.id === currentUser.sub) {
          isSelf = true;
        }
        if (info.parentType.name === 'Patron' && root.id === currentUser.sub) {
          isSelf = true;
        }
        if (!hasRole && !isSelf) {
          throw authError;
        }

        return value;
      };
    });
  }
}

export const authDirectives = {
  auth: AuthDirective,
};
</code></pre>
<br />

Once the directive is defined, we'll need to add it to our schema by re-exporting it with the other directive we've created.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
import { typeDef as dateTypeDef, dateDirectives } from './date';
<mark>import { typeDef as authTypeDef, authDirectives } from './auth';</mark>

export const directiveTypeDefs = [
  dateTypeDef,
  <mark>authTypeDef,</mark>
];

export const schemaDirectives = {
  ...dateDirectives,
  <mark>...authDirectives,</mark>
};
</code></pre>
<br />

We can apply our new directive by simply referencing it in our typeDefs.

We can specify roles required for both <code class="language-graphql">checkoutAsset</code> and <code class="language-graphql">checkinAsset</code> mutations.
We'll allow users to check out assets in a self-serve style, but restrict the checkin of assets back into the library to our librarians.

<pre><code class="language-graphql">
# File: src/schema/checkout/checkout.typeDef.js
extend type Mutation {

  "Check an asset out of the library. User must have role USER"
  checkoutAsset(assetUpc: String!, userEmail: String! @email): CheckOut! <mark>@auth(requires: USER)</mark>

  "Check an asset back into the library. User must have role LIBRARIAN"
  checkinAsset(assetUpc: String!): CheckOut! <mark>@auth(requires: LIBRARIAN)</mark>
}
</code></pre>
<br />

We can restrict querying our patron information as well. We'll want to allow users to query their own patron information while restricting access to other
patrons to only our librarians. Furthermore, we'll want to restrict access to the contact information (email and cell phone) to our admin users.

<pre><code class="language-graphql">
# File: src/schema/patron/patron.typeDef.js
extend type Query {
  "Query for patron information. Must have role LIBRARIAN"
  patron(email: String @email, id: ID): Patron @auth(requires: LIBRARIAN, allowSelf: true)
  patrons(yearRegistered: Int, limit: Int): [Patron]! @auth(requires: LIBRARIAN)
}

type Patron {
  id: ID!
  yearRegistered: Int
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
  email: String @auth(requires: ADMIN, allowSelf: true)
  phoneCell: String @email @auth(requires: ADMIN, allowSelf: true)
  checkOuts(currentCheckoutsOnly: Boolean): [CheckOut]
}
</code></pre>
<br />

Now, if we get a JWT for our librarian user and use that token to query information about our "apickerin0@51.la" making certain to specify the token in the
Authorization Header we should see that we are able to query the fields that we have access to and receive errors stating that we are not authorized to see the
email and phoneCell fields.

<pre><code class="language-shell">
curl -X POST http://localhost:4080/login -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'username=user2&password=password2'
</code></pre>
<br />
![playground-headers]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screenshots/auth/graphql-playground-headers.png)
<pre><code class="language-graphql">
{
  patron(email: "apickerin0@51.la") {
    id
    firstName
    lastName
    email
    phoneCell
  }
}
</code></pre>
<br />

If, however, we run the exact same query with a token we got for either our "user1" or "apickerin0@51.la" user, all fields should be populated without error.

## Conclusion

Just like other APIs, there are many different ways to implement authentication and authorization in GraphQL server. The exact methods that you choose will
depend greatly on your environment, organization and data. Using abstracted authorization methods in resolvers and defining access controls in custom directives
are just two powerful ways that GraphQL can allow you to protect your data from granular field level access all the way up to broad api level access.
