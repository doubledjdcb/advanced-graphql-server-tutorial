# Modularize the GraphQL Schema

In this tutorial we will go over the techniques and libraries that will aid you in modularizing your server code.  As our GraphQL server grows and we add more
and more typeDefs and resolver functions, we‚Äôre going to want to split out this new functionality into manageable code segments. The details on how you split
out your business logic will depend greatly on your business needs as well as preferences of your team.

## Separation of Concerns

The first thing that we are going to want to do is remove all typeDefs and resolvers from our main index.js file. Our goal is to restrict the functionality in our
main index.js to only handle the initialization and eventual termination of the GraphQL server itself. From there we can structure our code in a way that makes
the code base easier to understand and maintain.

## Project Structure

There is no one size fits all solution to project structure. Many teams will prefer to separate their code files by the type of data. For GraphQL, that may mean
putting all of the typeDef files into one folder and all of the resolver files into another folder. Other teams will prefer to separate their code files based
on the data that is associated with those files. That may mean that separate folders will be created for each custom type in the schema. There is no right or
wrong method for structuring your project. The goal is to make your project easy to maintain and understand.

In this tutorial, we will be structuring the code to match the custom types in the schema. When working on all of the operations for a particular piece of data,
I find it useful to have all required parts (typeDefs, resolvers, etc) located next to each other in my source code. This is similar to how Martijn Walraven
described Schema Composition at the GraphQL 2018 summit.

<br />

I encourage you to explore different project structures and choose one that works for you and your team.

## Extract Schema Data

To begin, create a folder named schema at the root of the src folder in your project. This folder will exist to contain all of our typeDefs, resolvers and any
helper functions that the resolvers will use to fetch or manipulate data.

Next we will create a folder within schemas for each module. Since we only have the one module right now, we‚Äôll create a folder called ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù.

In this folder, create three files as described above and name them ‚Äúcheckout.typeDef.js‚Äù, ‚Äúcheckout.resolvers.js‚Äù, and ‚Äúcheckout.model.js‚Äù.  These
names are mostly arbitrary. Since the containing folder is already called ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù we could drop that part from the file name. I like to keep file names
verbose to help me easily identify the purpose of the files which, for me, makes it easier to find and identify files as my project grows to include many
typeDef and resolver files.

From our index.js file, we can cut and paste the contents of the gql tag defining the current typeDefs and paste that into the newly created checkout.typeDef.js
file. You‚Äôll notice that we will no longer use the gql tag. Instead, we export a single constant that is our typeDef as just a string using template string
syntax for easy multi-line support. Many IDEs have plugins and extensions available to aid in the development of graphql types. Installing and enabling can be
useful for development. By adding the `/* GraphQL */` identifier before our template string, our IDE can perform proper syntax highlighting if an appropriate
extension is loaded. Using VS Code I prefer [Apollo GraphQL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.vscode-apollo).

<pre><code class="language-graphql">
// File: src/schema/checkout/checkout.typeDef.js
const typeDef = /* GraphQL */`
  type Query {
    checkouts(userEmail: String, assetUpc: String): [CheckOut]
  }

  type CheckOut {
    userEmail: String!
    assetUpc: String!
    checkoutDate: String!
    checkinDate: String
  }
`;

export default typeDef;
</code></pre>
<br />

Now let‚Äôs extract the resolvers from the index.js by separating that definition into two parts. All of the logic that is used to create and execute our query
will be extracted into the checkout.model.js file. In addition to that, we‚Äôll split our our resolver function into two pieces and abstract the logic to create
the query string into its own function.  As your application grows in scope and complexity, breaking your code into smaller chunks will very useful for both
readability of the code as well as testability of the code.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: src/schema/checkout/checkout.model.js
import mysqlDataConnector from '../../data-connectors/mysql';

const checkoutTableVariablesMap = {
  userEmail: 'user_email',
  assetUpc: 'asset_upc',
  checkoutDate: 'checkout_date',
  checkinDate: 'checkin_date',
};

function getQueryStr(args) {
  const requestedMySQLFields = Object.keys(checkoutTableVariablesMap).map(key => `${checkoutTableVariablesMap[key]} as ${key}`);
  let queryStr = `select ${requestedMySQLFields.join(',')} from checkouts`;

  const argEntries = Object.entries(args);
  if (argEntries.length > 0) {
    const whereClause = `WHERE ${argEntries.map(arg => `${checkoutTableVariablesMap[arg[0]]}=?`).join(' AND ')}`;
    queryStr = mysqlDataConnector.format(`${queryStr} ${whereClause}`, argEntries.map(arg => arg[1]));
  }
  return queryStr;
}

const CheckOut = {
  getCheckouts: async (root, args) => {
    const queryStr = getQueryStr(args);
    const queryResults = await mysqlDataConnector.pool.query(queryStr);
    return queryResults;
  },
};

export default CheckOut;
</code></pre>
<br />

With our query logic abstracted into its own file, our resolver code file can specific to declaring resolver definitions. In our checkouts.resolver.js file, we
can simply import our newly abstracted resolver handler and map that to the query definition.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: src/schema/checkout/checkout.resolver.js
import CheckOut from './checkout.model';

export default {
  Query: {
    checkouts: CheckOut.getCheckouts,
  },
  CheckOut: {
    checkinDate: (checkout) => {
      if (checkout.checkinDate instanceof Date) {
        return checkout.checkinDate.toISOString();
      }
      return null;
    },
    checkoutDate: checkout => checkout.checkoutDate.toISOString(),
  },
};
</code></pre>

## Consolidate Extracted Schemas

Since our type definitions are no longer specified in our main index.js file, we will need to import them in order to register them with the Apollo Server. In
the root of our schema folder, we will create an index.js file to aggregate all of our typeDef and resolver data into a single schema object that can be used by
Apollo Server.  There are two libraries that we will install to assist us in this step: [graphql-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-tools) and
[lodash.merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.merge).

In GraphQL, types can only be defined once and the schema will fail validation if more than one declaration is found for the same type. GraphQL provides a
syntax for extending a previously defined type, however. Since we will be defining Query types in multiple locations, we will update our checkout.typeDef.js
file to extend the Query type.

<pre><code class="language-graphql">
// File: src/schema/checkout/checkout.typeDef.js
const typeDef = /* GraphQL */`
  <mark>extend</mark> type Query {
    checkouts(userEmail: String, assetUpc: String): [CheckOut]
  }
...
</code></pre>

We now need to declare the Query type somewhere for it to be extended and we will do that in the schema/index.js file and add it
as the first item in our typeDefs array. In later tutorials, we will be adding Mutations and Subscriptions to our project, so we can declare those types right away as
well.

Begin by running `npm install graphql-tools lodash.merge` and then importing our dependencies and both the resolver and typeDef files. Each typeDef will be an item in an array and all of the resolvers will be merged
into a single object with each of these then being passed to the makeExecutableSchema function of the graphql-tools to create our schema. Our default export of
this file is our newly created schema.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// File: src/schema/index.js
import { makeExecutableSchema } from 'graphql-tools';
import merge from 'lodash.merge';

import checkoutResolver from './checkout/checkout.resolver';
import checkoutTypeDef from './checkout/checkout.typeDef';

const baseTypeDef = /* GraphQL */`
  type Query {
    _: Boolean
  }
  type Mutation {
    _: Boolean
  }
  type Subscription {
    _: Boolean
  }
`;

const typeDefs = [
  baseTypeDef,
  checkoutTypeDef,
];

const resolvers = merge(
  checkoutResolver,
);

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

export default schema;
</code></pre>

## Update the Apollo Server Config

The Apollo Server can be initialized with a single ‚Äúschema‚Äù option, so we will now import our previously exported schema into our main server index.js file and
update our Apollo Server setup.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: /src/index.js
import express from 'express';
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server-express';
import schema from './schema';
import env from './env';

const server = new ApolloServer({ schema });

const app = express();
server.applyMiddleware({ app });

app.listen({ port: env.GRAPHQL_SERVER_PORT }, () => console.log(`üöÄ Server ready at http://localhost:${env.GRAPHQL_SERVER_PORT}${server.graphqlPath}`));

</code></pre>

At this point, you should be able to start up the GraphQL server in debug mode, visit [http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql](http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql) and
successfully run the same queries that you had before and return the same set of 5 results.

<pre><code class="language-graphql">{
  checkouts (userEmail: "dbernath27@jalbum.net") {
    userEmail
    assetUpc
    checkoutDate
    checkinDate
  }
}</code></pre>
