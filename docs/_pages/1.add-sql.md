# Adding an SQL Data Source

In this tutorial we will replace our statically defined data set with the results from a query to a MySQL database. Before beginning this tutorial, you will
need to have performed the prerequisite steps in the [Getting Started](/tutorial/getting-started) section and started the data sources by running
<code class="language-sheell">npm run data-start</code>.

## Connection Pooling

In order to make a call to our database, we must first open a connection to that database. Connecting to a database can be a resource expensive task and is
something we want to do as infrequently as possible. The Node.js driver that we will be using for MySQL, as well as drivers for many other databases, includes
the ability to create connection pools so that connections made to the database can be maintained and used by later queries.

## Note on Library Dependencies

As a side note on licensing and npm package selections, the Node.js library that we will be using comes from
[https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql), this differs from the official [library from
Oracle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mysql/xdevapi). The reason for this is due to the license of each of the libraries. The GPL-2.0 license that covers
@mysql/xdevapi may not be suitable for your environment.

## Create the Database Connector

In the next tutorial we will be modularizing our GraphQL types and resolvers so they are not all defined in the main index.js file. To help prepare for this,
we’re going to set up our MySQL database connection in a way that will allow us to use ES6 modules to import the same connection pool instance that was created
on server startup from anywhere in our code. We’ll also convert some of the methods of our pool instance to promise-based methods to allow us to use the new
async/await syntax which was finalized and added to the ECMAScript standard in ES2017.  The final MySQL data connector export is an instance of an ES6 class
that holds all of our pool and current connection information. See the code in the
[/src/data-connectors/mysql.js](https://github.com/hydrateio/advanced-graphql-server-tutorial/blob/step-1-add-mysql-connection/src/data-connectors/mysql.js)
file.

## Managing Connection Variables

You may notice that variables used to connect to our MySQL database are coming from our env.js file. We want to make our server as environment independent as
possible as well as removing the possibility of exposing connection credentials. In order to accomplish this task, we will be using Node's ability to read and
use environment variables in our server scripts. Since these environment variables must be defined in order for connections to be made, we'll also want our
server to exit with an error if any required variables are not set. We also want a mechanism that will allow us to easily use the same set of predefined
variables in our development environment.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: src/env.js
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

const environmentVariables = {
  GRAPHQL_SERVER_PORT: process.env.GRAPHQL_SERVER_PORT || null,
  MYSQL_HOST: process.env.MYSQL_HOST || null,
  MYSQL_USER: process.env.MYSQL_USER || null,
  MYSQL_PASSWORD: process.env.MYSQL_PASSWORD || null,
  MYSQL_DATABASE: process.env.MYSQL_DATABASE || null,
  MYSQL_CONNECTION_POOL_LIMIT: parseInt(process.env.MYSQL_CONNECTION_POOL_LIMIT, 10) || 10,
  MYSQL_TIMEZONE: process.env.MYSQL_TIMEZONE || 'Z',
};

/**
 * Check that all required environment variable have been set and exit server if any are not defined.
 */
const missingEnvs = Object.keys(environmentVariables).filter(key => environmentVariables[key] === null);
const isMissingEnv = missingEnvs.length > 0;

if (isMissingEnv) {
  console.error('The following required environment variables are missing');
  console.error(missingEnvs.join('\n'), '\n');
  process.exit(1);
}

export default environmentVariables;
</code></pre>
<br />

Our env.js file first imports and uses the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) library. This allows us to store our values in a `.env` file at the
root of our project. It then sets default values for some variables and validates that all required variables have values. If any required variable is unset,
the server process exits with an error printed to stderr.

Our `.env` file that we can use for development will contain the following

<pre><code class="language-shell">
# File: .env
GRAPHQL_SERVER_PORT=4000
MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1
MYSQL_USER=graphql
MYSQL_PASSWORD=graphqlpw
MYSQL_DATABASE=central-library
MYSQL_CONNECTION_POOL_LIMIT=10
MYSQL_TIMEZONE=Z
</code></pre>
<br />

When running in a production environment, the .env file is likely to not be available and environment variables will be passed directly to the running server
using a process dependant on the environment which runs the server.

## Use SQL for Data

Now that we have our mechanisms for making a query to our MySQL database set up, we can begin to create and execute our query. In our src/index.js file, import
the new data connector as a dependency.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: src/index.js
import mysqlDataConnector from './data-connectors/mysql';</code></pre>

In the resolvers that we defined, we will update our checkouts query. First, since we will be using async/await, we will specify that our checkouts query is an
async function. 
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    checkouts: async (root, args) => {
      ...
    }
  },
  ...
};
</code></pre>

## Handle Data Definition Discrepancies

Since our GraphQL typeDefs may not match up exactly to the corresponding column names in our database, we’ll need to create some sort of map to translate one
into the other.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: src/index.js
const checkoutTableVariablesMap = {
  userEmail: 'user_email',
  assetUpc: 'asset_upc',
  checkoutDate: 'checkout_date',
  checkinDate: 'checkin_date',
};
</code></pre>

Now that we have that map, we can construct the query to be sent to the MySQL database. In this example, we are iterating over all of the fields that we
specified in our typeDef and requesting that the response columns be named to match our typeDef property names.

## Generate Safe Queries

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: src/index.js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    checkouts: async (root, args) => {
      const requestedMySQLFields = Object.keys(checkoutTableVariablesMap).map(key => `${checkoutTableVariablesMap[key]} as ${key}`);
      let queryStr = `select ${requestedMySQLFields.join(',')} from checkouts`;
      ...
    },
  },
</code></pre>

Our current checkouts query allows for arguments to be sent in order for results to be filtered. We can pass this filter along to MySQL by modifying our query
to add a WHERE clause in order to reduce load on the database query. Be certain to use sanitation techniques provided by your database connection library to
make certain that user passed variables are not being sent directly to your database query in order to prevent SQL injection attacks. For our driver, we are
using the format method provided by the mysql library.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: src/index.js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    checkouts: async (root, args) => {
      ...
      const argEntries = Object.entries(args);
      if (argEntries.length > 0) {
        const whereClause = `WHERE ${argEntries.map(arg => `${checkoutTableVariablesMap[arg[0]]}=?`).join(' AND ')}`;
        queryStr = mysqlDataConnector.format(`${queryStr} ${whereClause}`, argEntries.map(arg => arg[1]));
      },
    },
</code></pre>

## Retrieve Data and Handle Results

Now, instead of returning the static data, we can return the results or our database query.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: src/index.js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    checkouts: async (root, args) => {
      ...
      const queryResults = await mysqlDataConnector.pool.query(queryStr);
      return queryResults;
    },
  },
</code></pre>

## Handle Data Type Discrepancies

There is one more step that we may need to add depending on how are data is stored at the source and how it is defined in our typeDef. GraphQL will perform type
coercion. This means that it will attempt to take the value returned from your data source and coerce it into the type defined in your typeDef. In our example,
our “checkinDate” and “checkoutDate” columns in our MySQL database are stored at DATETIME objects and our typeDef is stating that it should be returned as a
String. The effect of this is that our date objects may not be returned in the format that we really want. To fix this, we will update our resolvers to
correctly format our dates in the string format that we want.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// File: src/index.js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    ...
  },
  CheckOut: {
    checkinDate: (checkout) => {
      if (checkout.checkinDate instanceof Date) {
        return checkout.checkinDate.toISOString();
      }
      return null;
    },
    checkoutDate: checkout => checkout.checkoutDate.toISOString(),
  },
};
</code></pre>

## Verify GraphQL Query

We can verify that we are now querying from the MySQL database by running the same query as before in our GraphQL Playground at
[http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql](http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql). This time, however, we should see 4 results for the following query since our MySQL data set
has been set up to include more entries than our statically defined data set.

<pre><code class="language-graphql">
{
  checkouts (userEmail: "dbernath27@jalbum.net") {
    userEmail
    assetUpc
    checkoutDate
    checkinDate
  }
}
</code></pre>
